Client:

The client first send SYN and wait for SYN-ACK from the server.
Then after sending ACK, starting sending packets of file data with size 1024 (with header)
After sending each packet, waits for TIMEOUT value. If timeout, resend the packet.
After receiving each ACK, the TIMEOUT gets recomputed using the algorithm from the lecture.
Sequence number gets adds by 1 each time an ACK is received.
Finally, after sending the whole file, sends FIN, waits for FIN-ACK. Waits for FIN and sends FIN-ACK.


Server:

The server first waits for SYN and send SYN-ACK and waits for data packets. 
For every packet received, it checks the checksum, if checksum is incorrect, it will drop the packet.
For every data packet received, it will check the sequence number to see whether it is a duplicated packet.
This happens when the timeout value for the sender is too small so that it resend a poacket which has already been 
received by the server.
When a duplicated packet is seen, it will drop it.
After receiving and writting the whole file, it will wait for FIN from client and send FIN-ACK. Then send FIN and waits for FIN-ACK.
